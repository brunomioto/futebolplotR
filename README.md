<!-- The goal of nbaplotR is to provide functions and geoms that help visualization of NBA/WNBA related analysis. It provides a ggplot2 geom that does the heavy lifting of plotting NBA/WNBA logos in high quality, with correct aspect ratio and possible transparency. All of this is done by the powerful [ggpath package](https://mrcaseb.github.io/ggpath/). -->

## Installation

<!-- The easiest way to get nbaplotR is to install it from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=nbaplotR) with: -->
<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("nbaplotR") -->
<!-- ``` -->
